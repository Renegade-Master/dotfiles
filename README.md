# Environment Configuration Dot Files

## Description

This repository contains the configuration files that I generally use in
my working environments.

There are configuration files present for the following programs:

- Firefox (userChrome.css)
- Git
- HTOP
- PowerShell 7 (pwsh)
- Tmux
- Vim/NeoVim
- ZSH (Oh-My-Zsh)

There is also a `.usrrc` which can be sourced into most Shells.
